"My-resources" allows users to make Exegol their own and customize it even further. This feature relies on a simple volume shared between the host and all exegol containers, and an advanced integration in the Exegol images directly. It allows users to enjoy their own tools that are not available in Exegol but also to customize their Exegol setup

The volume is accessible from the host at ~/.exegol/my-resources/ and from the containers (if the feature was left enabled at the container creation) at /opt/my-resources.

WARNING

The "my-resources" feature will do what it's told to do. If users choose to use that feature to replace files or configuration, those replacements should take place. So if there are some additions to Exegol you're not getting, it could be because you have a "my-resources" setup that replaces it.

Below are the features offered by "My-resources", allowing users to extend Exegol beyond what is initially included (tools, resources).

    Custom tools: users can place their own custom standalone tools, binaries and scripts in the "my-resources" volume. This volume is accessible from all containers at /opt/my-resources.
    Supported setup: users can customize their exegol environments automatically and transparently without having to manually setting things up for each and every new Exegol container they create. In this functionality, a pre-set list of supported custom configuration is set, and will improve with time. It's the easier and most user-friendly approach to customizing a few configurations.
    User setup: In this functionality, a shell script can be populated with every command a user wishes its containers to run at their creation.

Custom tools
INFO

Available from version 3.0.0 of any exegol image.

In the container, the /opt/my-resources/bin/ folder (~/.exegol/my-resources/bin/ on the host) is automatically added to the PATH of the zsh shell. The user can then add tools in that folder in order to use them from the container.
TIP

The most simple approach would be to add standalone binaries, but users could also add symbolic links that would point to somewhere else in /opt/my-resources/.

# Example for a standalone binary on your host
cp /path/to/tool ~/.exegol/my-resources/bin/
# or for a standalone binary on your exegol container
cp /path/to/tool /opt/my-resources/bin/

# Example for a symbolic link from your host
git -C ~/.exegol/my-resources/ clone "https://github.com/someauthor/sometool"
ln -s ../sometool/script.py ~/.exegol/my-resources/bin/script.py
# or from your exegol container
git -C /opt/my-resources/ clone "https://github.com/someauthor/sometool"
ln -s /opt/my-resources/sometool/script.py /opt/my-resources/bin/script.py

Supported setups

Configuration files stored in the /opt/my-resources/setup/ directory will be deployed on the containers and allow users to customize Exegol even further. By default, the number of officially supported configuration files is limited, and it depends on the version of the image itself, not the wrapper.
TIP

In order to see what configuration files are supported in your version, the /opt/supported_setups.md documentation file can be read from any container.

This documentation will reference in detail all the supported customizations available over time, and the corresponding minimum image version required for each one.

If a user wants to deploy tools and configurations that are not supported, or more advanced, they can opt for the User setup.
apt (packages, sources, keys)
INFO

Available from version 3.0.0 of any exegol image.

A system exists to easily install arbitrary APT packages in any new exegol container.

    Custom APT repositories can be added in exegol by filling in the /opt/my-resources/setup/apt/sources.list file
    Importing custom repositories usually requires importing GPG keys as well, which can be done by entering trusted GPG keys download URLs in the /opt/my-resources/setup/apt/keys.list file
    To install APT packages automatically (after updating the repository including the custom ones), just enter a list of package names in the /opt/my-resources/setup/apt/packages.list file

bloodhound (customqueries, config)
INFO

Available from version 3.1.0 of the ad and full images.

A system exists to easily add one or several bloodhound customqueries files, or change its configuration file in any new exegol container.

To automatically:

    overwrite the ~/.config/bloodhound/config.json configuration file, simply create the file /opt/my-resources/setup/bloodhound/config.json
    replace the default exegol customqueries, place one or several valid customqueries files into the folder /opt/my-resources/setup/bloodhound/customqueries_replacement/.
    merge with the default exegol customqueries by placing one or several valid customqueries files into the folder /opt/my-resources/setup/bloodhound/customqueries_merge/

TIP

To be considered for replacing or merging, the customqueries files must be valid and bear the .json extension. The file names do not matter. The output will be saved into the single file ~/.config/bloodhound/customqueries.json.
firefox (policy)
INFO

Available from version 3.1.6 of any exegol image.

A system exists to easily personalise firefox in any new exegol container.

The file /usr/lib/firefox-esr/distribution/policies.json can be used as a template in order to create your own Firefox policy. Your policy can then be copied to the location /opt/my-resources/setup/firefox/policies.json to apply it in the next container deployment (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-using-policiesjson), all available directives can be found here: https://mozilla.github.io/policy-templates/.
IMPORTANT

Your custom policy will overwrite the default policy created by Exegol.

The default policy applied by Exegol will do the following actions:

Add a few bookmarks

{
  "policies": {
    "ManagedBookmarks": [
      {
        "toplevel_name": "Exegol Bookmarks"
      },
      {
        "url": "https://exegol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/",

      },
      {
        "name": "References / Guides",
        "children": [
          {
            "url": "https://www.thehacker.recipes/",
            "name": "THR"
          },
          [...]
          {
            "url": "https://lolol.farm/",
            "name": "LOLOL Farm"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
}

Install a few extensions

{
  "policies": {
    "ExtensionSettings": {
      "foxyproxy@eric.h.jung": {
        "installation_mode": "force_installed",
        "install_url": "https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/foxyproxy-standard/latest.xpi"
      },
      [...]
    }
}

Disable a few Firefox features such as the telemetry

{
  "policies": {
    "DisableTelemetry": true,
    "DisplayBookmarksToolbar": "always",
    "UserMessaging": {
      "WhatsNew": false,
      "ExtensionRecommendations": false,
      "FeatureRecommendations": false,
      "UrlbarInterventions": false,
      "SkipOnboarding": true,
      "MoreFromMozilla": false
    }
}

Apply the CA of Burpsuite

{
  "policies": {
    "Certificates": {
        "Install": ["/opt/tools/firefox/cacert.der"]
    }
}

In order to install a specific addon, you can go to the Firefox addon webpage, and search for the addon GUID in the page HTML source code by searching for the JSON field "guid":, for example for the Dark Reader addon, the GUID is addon@darkreader.org, you can then add the extension in the JSON file:

"ExtensionSettings": {  
  "addon@darkreader.org": {  
    "installation_mode": "force_installed",
    "install_url": "https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/addon@darkreader.org/latest.xpi"
  },
}

To add a bookmark you can add a children to an existing folder in the ManagedBookmarks directive:

{
  "url": "https://www.thehacker.recipes/",
  "name": "THR"
}

or you can add a new folder:

{
  "name": "New folder",
  "children": [
    {
      "url": "https://regex101.com/",
      "name": "Regex101"
    }
  ]
}

TIP

You can create a structure with folders if you want some organization
User setup
INFO

Available from version 3.0.0 of any exegol image.

The /opt/my-resources/setup/load_user_setup.sh script is executed on the first startup of each new container that has the "my-resources" feature enabled. Arbitrary code can be added in this file, in order to customize Exegol (dependency installation, configuration file copy, etc).
WARNING

It is strongly advised not to overwrite the configuration files provided by exegol (e.g. /root/.zshrc, /opt/.exegol_aliases, ...), official updates will not be applied otherwise.
Permissions

To facilitate its use, a read/write access system shared (between the host user and the container root user) has been implemented.

To allow this permissions sharing, the "my-resources" folder (and all subdirectories) must have the Set-GID permission bit set. This is done automatically by the wrapper if the current user has sufficient rights. Otherwise, the wrapper will display a sudo command to be executed manually to update the relevant permissions.
Troubleshooting

In case of problem, the customization system logs all actions in the /var/log/exegol/load_setups.log file.

If the whole installation went smoothly the log file will be compressed by gunzip and will have the name /var/log/exegol/load_setups.log.gz
TIP

Logs in .gz format can be viewed directly without unpacking them with the zcat, zgrep, zdiff or zmore command!
